# -Data-Science-App-Development-workshop-by-coders-ready-
Recently I attended a 3 days workshop " Data Science &amp; App Development Workshop by Coders Ready" on Coding with python at CODERS READY. And here i'm uploading the most relevant information about it.
The workshop covered the length and breadth of python right from the basics of python to the advance level.
I got benefitted a lot by this workshop, not just at coding knowledge level but also understood the logic of coding. we worked on a lot of interesting coding concepts.
